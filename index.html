                <h2>What is Web3?</h2>
                <p>Web3 represents the next evolution of the internet - a decentralized web built on blockchain technology. Unlike Web2 where large companies control data and services, Web3 aims to give users ownership and control over their digital assets and data. It's powered by cryptocurrencies, smart contracts, and decentralized networks.</p>

                <h2>Key Terms</h2>
                <div class="terms-grid">
                    <div class="term-card">
                        <h3>Blockchain</h3>
                        <p>A digital ledger that records transactions across many computers. Think of it as a chain of digital blocks, where each block contains transaction data. Once recorded, the data cannot be changed, making it secure and transparent.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="term-card">
                        <h3>Wallet</h3>
                        <p>A digital tool that stores your cryptocurrency and allows you to send and receive digital assets. It's like a bank account for crypto, but you have complete control - no bank needed. It contains your private keys (passwords) and public addresses.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="term-card">
                        <h3>Smart Contract</h3>
                        <p>Self-executing programs stored on a blockchain that automatically run when certain conditions are met. Imagine a vending machine - you put in money, select an item, and it automatically delivers without needing a person to operate it.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="term-card">
                        <h3>NFT</h3>
                        <p>Non-Fungible Token - a unique digital certificate that proves ownership of a digital item. Unlike cryptocurrencies where each coin is the same, each NFT is one-of-a-kind, like a digital collectible or artwork.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="term-card">
                        <h3>DeFi</h3>
                        <p>Decentralized Finance - financial services built on blockchain technology that operate without traditional banks or intermediaries. You can lend, borrow, trade, and earn interest directly through smart contracts.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="term-card">
                        <h3>DAO</h3>
                        <p>Decentralized Autonomous Organization - a community-led entity with no central authority. Members vote on decisions using tokens, like a digital cooperative where everyone has a say in how things are run.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="term-card">
                        <h3>Gas Fees</h3>
                        <p>Transaction fees paid to process and validate transactions on a blockchain network. Like paying for postage to send a letter, you pay gas fees to send cryptocurrency or interact with smart contracts.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="term-card">
                        <h3>Ethereum</h3>
                        <p>The second-largest cryptocurrency platform that introduced smart contracts. While Bitcoin is digital money, Ethereum is a programmable blockchain where developers can build decentralized applications (dApps).</p>
